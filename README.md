<h1 align="center">Sample Client for Amazon Bedrock</h1>

English / [简体中文](./README_CN.md)

It is a Bedrock client forked from https://github.com/Yidadaa/ChatGPT-Next-Web/

And it was simplified to support AWS Bedrock only.

## Important Notice:
```
This project is a sample project intended solely to showcase the process of building a chatting client that connects to LLM models like Claude3 on Bedrock. 

It is not a production-ready client, and it should not be used in a production environment without further development and testing.
```

#### For Developer:


As the project is still in rapid itelating, we would like to suggest developers to build it their own version following the following steps:

1. git clone current project: `git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-client-for-amazon-bedrock.git`
2. install yarn on your desktop
3. go to the project folder
4. run `yarn install` to install all the dependences of the project
5. run `yarn app:dev` to start a desktop app in developer mode.    or:   run `yarn dev` to start a local server and then access the app with browser.
6. Optional, if you want to run it as an app, run `yarn app:build` to build it, and the find the target file (we believe you can, :-)

#### IAM Permissions

To get started with BRClient, you must create an IAM user and generate Access Key/Secret Key. You have two options:

* Option 1: Use the Managed Policy (Quick Setup)
  - Go to Identity and Access Management (IAM) -> Users -> Create User
  - Set permissions -> Select "Attach policies directly"
  - Choose `AmazonBedrockFullAccess`
  - Click Next -> Create User

* Option 2: Set Least-Privilege Permissions
  - When setting permissions with IAM policies, grant only the permissions required to perform a task. This is known as least-privilege permissions. Here's an example of least-privilege IAM Permissions for BRClient:
    ```json
    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
        "Sid": "LeastPrivilege4BRClient",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "bedrock:InvokeModel",
            "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream"
        ],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:bedrock:*::foundation-model/*"
        }
    ]
    }
    ```
