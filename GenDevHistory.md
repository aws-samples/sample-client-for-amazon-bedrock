## 2025-08-14 - Added Local JSON File Loading for Model Configuration

### Summary
Added a new "Load" button to the model configuration interface that allows users to load model configurations from local JSON files, complementing the existing remote URL update functionality.

### Changes Made

#### Files Modified
- `app/components/model-config.tsx`

#### Detailed Changes

1. **Updated Imports**
   - Added `useRef` import from React
   - Added `UploadIcon` import from `../icons/upload.svg`

2. **Added File Input Reference**
   - Added `const fileInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);` for managing the hidden file input

3. **Implemented File Handling Logic**
   - Created `handleFileLoad` function to process selected JSON files
   - Includes JSON parsing and validation
   - Updates app configuration with loaded models
   - Provides error handling with user-friendly alerts
   - Resets file input after processing to allow reselection of same file

4. **Enhanced UI Components**
   - Added hidden file input element with `.json` file restriction
   - Added new "Load" IconButton with upload icon
   - Positioned next to existing "Update" button for consistent UX
   - Added tooltip: "Load models from local JSON file"

#### Code Structure
```typescript
// File input reference
const fileInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

// File handling function
const handleFileLoad = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  // File reading and JSON parsing logic
  // Error handling and app config updates
};

// UI Elements
<input type="file" ref={fileInputRef} onChange={handleFileLoad} accept=".json" style={{ display: 'none' }} />
<IconButton onClick={() => fileInputRef.current?.click()} icon={<UploadIcon />} title="Load models from local JSON file" />
```

### Features Added
- **Local File Support**: Users can now load model configurations from local JSON files
- **File Validation**: Only accepts `.json` files with proper JSON format validation
- **Error Handling**: Displays alerts for invalid JSON files
- **Reusability**: File input resets after each use, allowing multiple file selections
- **Consistent UX**: Integrates seamlessly with existing update button interface
- **Visual Feedback**: Uses upload icon and provides descriptive tooltip

### Technical Details
- Uses HTML5 FileReader API for file processing
- Maintains existing app configuration update pattern
- Follows React best practices with useRef for DOM element access
- Includes TypeScript type safety for file input events

### User Experience
1. User clicks the new "Load" button (upload icon)
2. File selection dialog opens, filtered to show only `.json` files
3. Upon file selection, content is automatically parsed and loaded
4. Success/error feedback provided through console logging and alerts
5. Model list updates immediately upon successful load

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- New feature is additive and doesn't affect existing workflows
- Remote URL update functionality continues to work as before

### Future Considerations
- Could be extended to support other file formats (CSV, XML)
- Potential for drag-and-drop file upload interface
- Could add file content preview before loading
- Possible integration with file validation schemas
